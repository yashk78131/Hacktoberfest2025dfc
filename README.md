## What Is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source, organized annually by DigitalOcean (in partnership with community sponsors) to encourage people (developers, designers, writers, and non-coders too) to get involved in open-source projects. 

Since its inception, the mission remains simple:

- Encourage contributions to open projects  
- Bring in new contributors  
- Celebrate open source communities and maintainers  
- Provide incentives (digital badges, T-shirts, recognition) 
Over the years, Hacktoberfest has grown from just hundreds of participants to tens of thousands.

### Key Dates in 2025

- Hacktoberfest 2025 is officially open. 
- The global kickoff “From Code to Community” is on **October 1st**, virtual gathering. 
- Events (satellite sessions, workshops, meetups) are held throughout October. 


## How to Participate: Step by Step

Here’s how you can get involved and make the most of Hacktoberfest:

### 1. **Register / Sign Up**

Go to [Hacktoberfest.com](https://hacktoberfest.com) and connect your GitHub account. This links your contributions to your profile.
Once you register, you’ll get a digital badge (or “pin”) that upgrades as you complete accepted PRs. 

### 2. **Find Suitable Projects**

- Only repositories that have opted in (i.e. have the `hacktoberfest` topic) count as eligible. 
- Many projects label beginner-friendly issues as **“good first issue”** or **“help wanted”**. These are great for newcomers. 
- You can contribute to non-code areas as well: docs, translation, design, writing, tutorials, etc. 
- Keep your eyes on Hacktoberfest’s official event listings and community shared project lists. 

### 3. **Make Pull or Merge Requests**

- Fork or clone the repo  
- Create a new branch  
- Make your changes or additions  
- Submit a PR (or merge request)  
- Be sure to follow the project’s contribution guidelines  
- Maintain good PR hygiene: clear commit messages, description of what you did, link to issue (if any)  
- Engage with maintainers: respond to feedback and revise if needed  

### 4. **Ensure PRs Are Accepted / Approved**

For a PR to count:

- The repository must be eligible (have `hacktoberfest` topic)  
- The PR must be merged, **or** labeled `hacktoberfest-accepted` by a maintainer  
- Some PRs may be accepted after the October window within a review grace period 
- The total needed for “completion” is currently **6 accepted PRs** in many Hacktoberfest editions. 

### 5. 🎁 Hacktoberfest 2025 Rewards

- 🪪 **Holopin** — Earn a digital Hacktoberfest badge + unique Holopin sticker for socials.  
- 👕 **Swag (T-Shirt)** — Exclusive T-shirt for **Super Contributors** (6 accepted PRs/MRs, first 10,000 only).  
- 🌱 **TreeNation** — With the T-shirt reward, a tree is planted to support a greener planet.  

👉 Even if you don’t hit the T-shirt tier, every contributor gets digital recognition and a chance to showcase their journey!


## Why You Should Join Hacktoberfest

Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting out, Hacktoberfest offers many benefits:

- **Skill growth & learning** — working on real projects improves your coding, collaboration, and review skills  
- **Portfolio & visibility** — your GitHub contributions are public and can be shown to employers  
- **Community & networking** — meet contributors, maintainers, and mentors worldwide  
- **Giving back** — open-source projects power much of the tech stack we rely on  
- **Fun & motivation** — friendly challenge, rewards, and shared energy through October  
- **Non-code opportunities** — docs, design, translation, writing, testing are also valid ways to contribute.


## Pitfalls & Best Practices (Don’t Become “Spamtoberfest”)

Over the years, maintaining event integrity and quality has been a challenge. Here are things to watch out for:

### Common Pitfalls

- Submitting many trivial PRs (e.g. white-space fixes) just to hit count  
- PRs to ineligible repos (without the `hacktoberfest` topic)  
- Not responding to maintainer feedback, resulting in PR rejections  
- Working on mega complex issues without understanding the project  
- Ignoring contribution guidelines  
- Assuming every PR will be accepted — some valid ones might still be rejected or need revisions  

### Best Practices & Tips

1. **Aim for quality over quantity** — better fewer meaningful contributions  
2. **Choose beginner-friendly issues first**  
3. **Communicate early** — open an issue or comment before heavy work  
4. **Always read the project’s `CONTRIBUTING.md` / code of conduct**  
5. **Write clear PR descriptions**: what you changed, why, link to related issue  
6. **Be responsive to maintainer feedback & revise your code**  
7. **Track your PRs and deadlines** — maintainers often leave reviews near the end of October  
8. **Don’t be discouraged by rejections** — learn and try again  


## Example Projects & Organizations Participating (2025 Highlights)

- **Jenkins** — They encourage PRs in Jenkins repositories with `hacktoberfest` topic. 
- **Interledger** — showing examples of non-code contributions (documentation, issues) in their repos. 
- **Defold** — flagged some repos for “good first issue” contribution during Hacktoberfest. 
- **ServiceNow** — their community is active in Hacktoberfest, with advocacy and blogs. 

Additionally, many local and global events will run alongside Hacktoberfest (workshops, meetups, hackathons) — check the Hacktoberfest **Events** page.
